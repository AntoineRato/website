                    <p>My name is Antoine Rato, and I'm 27 years old. I was born on February 29th, which only happens
                        every 4 years for those of you who may be absent-minded.</p>
                    <p>Growing up, my father was a gamer, so I was born with a PC in my hands. It's no surprise that
                        video games became my big, BIG passion. Through my curiosity (thanks video games), I discovered
                        animation and coding with Adobe Flash when I was about 12 years old, then more seriously through
                        the C language which became my first "real" language. I was totally amazed and excited by the
                        things we could create.</p>
                    <p>During my higher education, I naturally pursued computer science and obtained my Master's degree
                        after 5 years of studies in alternation, which is becoming more and
                        more common in France and Europe (with this approach, students spend equal amounts of time
                        studying and working for a company, so they are able to cover the same amount of coursework as
                        those who do not participate in the program, and even more, as they gain valuable practical
                        experience that is highly sought after by employers).
                        I have always been greatly interested in innovation, but it was only towards the end of my
                        studies that I realized what I really needed was creativity (hence my attraction to innovation).
                        This led me to focus on the development of video games, where I could satisfy my need for
                        creativity in this 2D/3D universe that offers infinite possibilities.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I work at Voodoo, where I prototype hundreds of features in a variety of mobile games.
                        This is an efficient way to discover different approaches for achieving tasks and for
                        experimentation. Joining Voodoo has made me a much better developer than before, and I am very
                        grateful for that.</p>

                    <p>In addition to my work, I also create my own video games and experiment with new things whenever
                        I get the chance. Check out the blog section to see my latest works.</p>
