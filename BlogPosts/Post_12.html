                <h2>Turning the Tables: Using the Environment to Your Advantage</h2>
                <p class="post-date">Posted on December 4, 2022</p>

                <p>In the world of casual games, environmental interactions can be just as crucial as they are in
                    hypercasual titles, like I demonstrated in <a href="Post_06.html">my previous post</a> on <b>Cannon
                        it!</b>.</p>

                <p>This time, I'll be exploring the ways in which we can use the environment to our advantage—or
                    occasionally to our disadvantage—in casual games.</p>

                <p>From plot twists to strategic gameplay, let's dive into the creative possibilities!</p>

                <h3>Zombies Eraser</h3>

                <p>This first-person shooter requires you to fend off hordes of zombies. Inspired by the overwhelming
                    number of zombies in World War Z, I wanted to create a similar vibe.</p>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OzG6aaovvk8?controls=1"
                        title="Zombies Eraser - Falling Container video" frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Zombies Eraser - Falling Container video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>In this example I created, the environment plays a key role in both helping and hindering the player.
                    When a massive group of zombies approaches, the player might attempt to release a container to block
                    their path. However, the noise from the container attracts even more zombies, leaving the player in
                    a worse situation than before.</p>

                <div class="duo-videos">
                    <figure>
                        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zueod5I86uQ?controls=1"
                            title="Zombies Eraser - Falling Bridge video" frameborder="0"
                            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                            allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <figcaption>Zombies Eraser - Falling Bridge video</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <figure>
                        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HU2SKQxOcvI?controls=1"
                            title="Zombies Eraser - Fake Falling Bridge video" frameborder="0"
                            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                            allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <figcaption>Zombies Eraser - Fake Falling Bridge video</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>Two additional variants include a bridge that can be destroyed to crush zombies or potentially
                    backfire and leave the player to deal with them the old-fashioned way.</p>

                <h3>Cover Raid</h3>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s5N7djmPkXk?controls=1"
                        title="Cover Raid - Wall destroyed video" frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Cover Raid - Wall destroyed video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>This cover shooter game challenges players' assumptions about red explosive barrels commonly found in
                    video games.</p>

                <p>In the video I created, the player encounters three powerful enemies and decides to shoot a nearby
                    red barrel, expecting an easy victory. To their surprise, the explosion reveals a dozen
                    strategically positioned enemies, making the situation much more difficult than anticipated.</p>

                <h3>Castle War</h3>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kioBwayPkQ?controls=1" title="Castle War - Bridge destroyed video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Castle War - Bridge destroyed video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p><b>Castle War</b> is a game where players defend their castle against invaders by upgrading defenses
                    and controlling a ballista.</p>

                <p>In this example, I introduce a bonus level with an overwhelming number of enemies. Players must use
                    their cunning and the environment to succeed. In these two variants above, timely destruction of a
                    bridge eliminates most of the enemies.</p>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QmFwnWz-tE4?controls=1"
                        title="Castle War - Flaming arrow video" frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Castle War - Flaming arrow video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>As a bonus video, I added a flaming arrow power-up that allows players to set fire to a large horde
                    of enemies with a single well-placed shot.</p>

                <br />
                <br />

                <p>By incorporating environmental interactions in casual games, we can create moments of tension,
                    strategy, and surprise that keep players coming back for more. Stay tuned for more insights into my
                    game development journey!</p>
