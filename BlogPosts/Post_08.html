                <h2>Seasonal Updates: Injecting Festive Fun into Mobile Games</h2>
                <p class="post-date">Posted on August 26, 2022</p>

                <p>Hello, and welcome back to my blog! As a game developer, I love to bring excitement to mobile games by incorporating seasonal themes and elements, especially during widely celebrated events such as Halloween and Christmas.</p>

                <p>In this post, I'll share some examples of how I've added a festive touch to existing games, creating unique and entertaining experiences for players.</p>

                <h3>Halloween Horrors</h3>

                <p>For Halloween, I’ll show you 3 examples where I added spooky elements that immerse players in the eerie atmosphere of the season.</p>

                <h4>Scribble Rider</h4>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/?controls=1" title="Scribble Rider - Halloween gameplay video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Scribble Rider - Halloween gameplay video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>I already talked about in my previous post, <b>Scribble Rider</b> is a racing game where players must draw wheels to adapt to the changing level.</p>

                <p>I've transformed the game with a green hue, eerie smoke effects, chilling music, and the addition of zombies lurking behind the road and moving toward the player, creating a sense of urgency and fear.</p>

                <h4>Shortcut Run</h4>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/?controls=1" title="Shortcut Run - Halloween gameplay video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Shortcut Run - Halloween gameplay video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>I've previously discussed portal features in this game. In the Halloween version, instead of falling into water, players must avoid a lower ground filled with zombies.</p>

                <p>I've also added visual effects like graves, green smoke, and a Halloween-themed village to enhance the spooky vibe.</p>

                <h4>Dig This!</h4>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/?controls=1" title="Dig This! - Halloween gameplay video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Dig This! - Halloween gameplay video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>In this 2D sand-digging game, I've added design elements such as zombies, a skull replacing the ball, and morbid objects hidden in the sand.</p>

                <p>A new mechanic involves using a level prop, like cutting a wire to drop a chopper, which then takes out the zombies.</p>

                <h3>Christmas Cheer</h3>

                <p>For Christmas, one of the games I’ve worked on a festive update was the popular game, <b>Roof Rails</b>.</p>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/?controls=1" title="Left Turn! - Puzzle Parking video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Left Turn! - Puzzle Parking video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>While the changes are purely visual and don't affect gameplay, they create a warm, holiday atmosphere. I've added snow on the ground, Christmas-themed houses, and lights along the path, all accompanied by cheerful holiday music.</p>

                <h3>Bonus: Shark Infested Shortcut Run</h3>

                <p>Inspired by the Halloween version of <b>Shortcut Run</b>, I've created another variation where sharks inhabit the water alongside the player's path.</p>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/?controls=1" title="Left Turn! - Puzzle Parking video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Left Turn! - Puzzle Parking video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>These sharks can randomly jump over the path, potentially knocking the player back in the race or causing them to fall into the water. This adds a thrilling challenge and keeps players on their toes.</p>

                <br/>
                <br />

                <p>I take pride in creating immersive experiences that align with the festive spirit of popular events. Stay tuned for more updates on my work and my journey in the world of mobile game development!</p>
