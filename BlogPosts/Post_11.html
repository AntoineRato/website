                <h2>Revamping the Sticky Colors Experience</h2>
                <p class="post-date">Posted on November 2, 2022</p>

                <p>Hello, everyone!</p>
                <p>Today, I want to share with you an exciting update I made to the game Sticky Colors, focusing on
                    improving the comprehension and the initial gameplay session experience.</p>

                <p>In Sticky Colors, players control a sphere and roll it over scattered cubes to collect them,
                    eventually reforming the original shape in the center of the level.
                    <br />However, this concept might not be immediately apparent to first-time players or for
                    advertising purposes on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and other ads networks.
                </p>

                <p>To address this issue, I devised a way to make the gameplay more explicit while maintaining the core
                    game design.
                    <br />A few weeks earlier, I had stumbled upon a <a
                        href="https://twitter.com/MajorMcDoom/status/1591616633478565888?s=20">tweet from
                        MajorMcDoom</a>, showcasing a technique he created using proximity-based interpolation.
                </p>

                <p>This inspired me to implement a similar concept in Sticky Colors.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Now, when players begin a level, all the cubes are initially in place, forming the target shape.
                    After a few seconds, once the player has had time to observe the shape, the cubes rise and scatter
                    around the level.</p>

                <p>It's then up to the player to roll the sphere over the cubes, collecting them and reassembling the
                    original shape. This new approach makes the gameplay more accessible and engaging for both new and
                    returning players.</p>

                <p>I hope you enjoyed this insight into the improvements made to Sticky Colors. Stay tuned for more
                    updates on my work and my journey in the world of mobile game development!</p>
