                <h2>Revamping the Sticky Colors Experience</h2>
                <p class="post-date">Posted on November 2, 2022</p>

                <p>Hello, everyone!</p>
                <p>Today, I want to share with you an exciting update I made to the game Sticky Colors, focusing on improving the comprehension and the initial gameplay session experience.</p>

                <!-- Video of the original gameplay -->
                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/?controls=1" title="Title - Description video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Title - Description video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>In Sticky Colors, players control a sphere and roll it over scattered cubes to collect them, eventually reforming the original shape in the center of the level.
                    <br/>However, this concept might not be immediately apparent to first-time players or for advertising purposes on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and other ads networks.</p>

                <p>To address this issue, I devised a way to make the gameplay more explicit while maintaining the core game design.
                    <br/>A few weeks earlier, I had stumbled upon a <a href="https://twitter.com/MajorMcDoom/status/1591616633478565888?s=20">tweet from MajorMcDoom</a>, showcasing a technique he created using proximity-based interpolation.</p>

                    <p>This inspired me to implement a similar concept in Sticky Colors.</p>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/?controls=1" title="Title - Description video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Title - Description video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Now, when players begin a level, all the cubes are initially in place, forming the target shape. After a few seconds, once the player has had time to observe the shape, the cubes rise and scatter around the level.</p>

                <p>It's then up to the player to roll the sphere over the cubes, collecting them and reassembling the original shape. This new approach makes the gameplay more accessible and engaging for both new and returning players.</p>

                <p>I hope you enjoyed this insight into the improvements made to Sticky Colors. Stay tuned for more updates on my work and my journey in the world of mobile game development!</p>
