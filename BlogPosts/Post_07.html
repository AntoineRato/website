                <h2>Scribble Rider: Exciting Enhancements</h2>
                <p class="post-date">Posted on July 8, 2022</p>

                <p>Hello everyone, I hope you are having a amazing day! </p>
                <p>Today, I’d like to share with you some exciting works I've been done for <b>Scribble Rider</b>, a racing game where players must draw their vehicle's wheels to adapt to the level design.</p>
                <p>As one of Voodoo's flagship titles, <b>Scribble Rider</b> has been my primary focus, and it’s the game I’ve worked on the most so far.</p>

                <h3>Mario kart introduction</h3>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1qVTHezAbQ?controls=1" title="Scribble Rider - Mario Kart introduction video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Scribble Rider - Mario Kart introduction video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>This feature is straight from the famous Mario Kart title.</p>
                <p>I found the introduction which presents the circuit and the various faults and traps which it can contain interesting and I found that it adapted very well to <b>Scribble Rider</b>.</p>

                <h3>City Environment</h3>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/foAexVjLaaI?controls=1" title="Scribble Rider - City environment video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Scribble Rider - City environment video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Introducing a brand new level set in a city, complete with a massive skyscraper that players must climb and then tumble down and a new fresh new feature, the road is no longer straight, your car takes turns in some places!</p>

                <h3>Coin Animation</h3>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wn7ujAjnSQ0?controls=1" title="Scribble Rider - Coin animation video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Scribble Rider - Coin animation video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>When players pick up coins, a 3D-like animation appears on the screen, making the coin slide towards the total currency displayed at the top right corner of the UI.</p>

                <h3>Day and Night</h3>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iEA0wVmcg0E?controls=1" title="Scribble Rider - Day And Night video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Scribble Rider - Day And Night video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>I've added a day and night cycle during the race, complete with a rising and setting sun, creating an immersive visual experience.</p>

                <h3>Honey Slow</h3>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f51HU6_3Qfg?controls=1" title="Scribble Rider - Honey slow video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Scribble Rider - Honey slow video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>In this nature/farm-themed level, a tree with a beehive drops honey onto the track, significantly slowing players down and creating a sense of frustration as they struggle to move forward.</p>

                <h3>Joust Minigame</h3>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_9sqEC_brr0?controls=1" title="Scribble Rider - Joust Minigame video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Scribble Rider - Joust Minigame video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>A prototype mini-game where two players face each other in a jousting match. The goal is to knock the opponent down without falling yourself.</p>

                <h3>Secret Level Bridge</h3>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lo2thohdBFY?controls=1" title="Scribble Rider - Secret level bridge video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Scribble Rider - Secret level bridge video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>A secret bonus level that offers an unexpected challenge for players, with a great treasure waiting at the end if they can beat their opponent.</p>

                <h3>Typing Cheat Codes</h3>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2kJI_PwLVE?controls=1" title="Scribble Rider - Typing cheat codes video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Scribble Rider - Typing cheat codes video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>This feature is designed for an advertisement, showing the player trying out known cheat codes and eventually discovering one that greatly increases their speed.</p>
