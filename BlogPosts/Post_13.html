                <h2>Innovative Advertising for Castle Raid: Creating a Fake Augmented Reality Experience</h2>
                <p class="post-date">Posted on January 19, 2023</p>

                <p>Hello, fellow gamers! In today's post, I want to share with you an exciting project I worked on for the game <b>Castle Raid</b> and also my favorite task I did at Voodoo.</p>

                <p> Inspired by custom ads for games like <b>Top War</b> and <b>Lords Mobile: Kingdom Wars</b>, I set out to create an innovative ad for <b>Castle Raid</b> that simulates an augmented reality (AR) experience.</p>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/egzwTDZkPOM?controls=1" title="Castle Raid! - Original gameplay visual video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>

                </figure>

                <p><b>Castle Raid</b> is a game where players control an ever-advancing army, digging through obstacles and avoiding traps while collecting multipliers to grow their forces. In the end, the goal is to defeat the opposing army.</p>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNLD0e7DGgI?controls=1" title="Castle Raid! - Fake augmented reality video 2"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>

            </div>

                <p>Having previously worked with AR using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/">ARKit</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar">ARCore</a>, I decided to create a fake AR advertisement for <b>Castle Raid</b>.</p>

                <p>I removed all non-essential elements from the game, leaving only the obstacles, multipliers, and soldiers. Using <a href="https://quixel.com/">Quixel</a>, a library of photorealistic assets, I built a highly realistic environment and adjusted the lighting to create a faithful rendering.</p>

                <p>By removing certain elements from the original game and adding post-processing, I successfully integrated the game into its new setting, giving the impression of an AR experience, as you can see in the videos provided in this post.</p>

                <p>This fake AR technique has been so well received that other Voodoo developers have adopted it for their games, resulting in revenue increases ranging from 15% to 40%. I'm thrilled with the outcome and hope you enjoy this innovative advertising approach for <b>Castle Raid</b>.</p>
                
                <p>Stay tuned for more updates on my work and my journey in the world of mobile game development!</p>
