                <h2>Cannon It! Unleashing Creative Destruction with Bonus Levels</h2>
                <p class="post-date">Posted on June 11, 2022</p>

                <p>Hey there, gaming enthusiasts! In today's blog post, I'm excited to discuss the work I did on the
                    game Cannon It! This engaging title challenges players to demolish a castle using a limited number
                    of
                    bullets.</p>
                <p>To break the monotonous rhythm of the shooting gameplay and create surprises that keep players
                    engaged, I decided to create several levels with different ways to win. In this post, I'll share
                    five videos illustrating these exciting new possibilities.</p>

                <h3>Video 1: Triggering an Avalanche</h3>

                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Cannon It! - Avalanche video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>In the first video, the level is set against a snowy mountain backdrop.</p>

                <p>By shooting the mountains behind the castle, players can initiate an avalanche that obliterates
                    everything in its path and secures victory.</p>

                <h3>Videos 2 & 3: Toppling Trees and Unleashing Bananas</h3>

                <div class="duo-videos">
                    <figure>
                        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7YMqWWoRhC8?controls=1"
                            title="Cannon It! - Puzzle Parking video" frameborder="0"
                            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                            allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <figcaption>Cannon It! - Toppling tree video</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <figure>
                        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQKCrDLIVas?controls=1"
                            title="Cannon It! - Puzzle Parking video" frameborder="0"
                            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                            allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <figcaption>Cannon It! - Unleashing bananas video</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>The second and third videos showcase variations of a level set in a forest/jungle environment.</p>
                <p>As usual, players can opt to destroy the castle directly, or they can shoot a massive tree in the
                    background, causing it to topple over and crush the castle. In the third video, the collapsing tree
                    releases a torrent of bananas that demolish everything in sight.</p>

                <h3>Video 4: Unleashing a Boulder</h3>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqgocfW08J4?controls=1"
                        title="Cannon It! - Puzzle Parking video" frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Cannon It! - Unleashing a boulder video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>In the fourth video, the level takes place in a plain setting with a mountain in the background.A
                    gigantic boulder precariously balances atop the mountain, supported by a small stone.</p>
                <p>By shooting the small stone, players can release the boulder, sending it rolling downhill to
                    obliterate everything in its path.</p>

                <h3>Video 5: Bursting the Water Tower</h3>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yd5ko3q3Ek8?controls=1"
                        title="Cannon It! - Puzzle Parking video" frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Cannon It! - Bursting the Water Tower video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The fifth and final video features a level similar to the fourth, with a large water tower positioned
                    on a mountain. When players shoot the tower, water gushes out and destroys the castle/village below.
                </p>

                <h3>A Fresh Perspective: Aerial Destruction</h3>

                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1qsKav-7js?controls=1"
                        title="Cannon It! - Puzzle Parking video" frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Cannon It! - Airplane view video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>For an even more dynamic gameplay experience, I've included an additional bonus video that shifts the
                    player's perspective from the ground to an airplane.</p>

                <p>Now, players can enjoy an aerial view and a greater degree of control over their destructive powers.
                    They can aim directly at the castle or knock down trees to cause collateral damage to the village.
                    With this new feature, the possibilities for strategic destruction are virtually limitless.</p>

                <br />

                <p>As a game developer, my goal is to craft engaging and memorable experiences for players. I hope you
                    enjoy these videos showcasing the diverse ways to win a level in Cannon It! Stay tuned for more
                    insights and updates on my game development journey.</p>

                <p>Happy gaming!</p>
