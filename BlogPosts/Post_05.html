                <h2>Bounce and Collect: Creative Features to Elevate Hypercasual Mobile Gaming</h2>
                <p class="post-date">Posted on May 3, 2022</p>

                <p>Hello, fellow mobile game enthusiasts! Today, I'd like to share with you some exciting features that
                    I tested in one of my hypercasual mobile game projects from 2022, <b>Bounce and Collect</b>.</p>
                <p>In this game, players control a bucket filled with balls and strategically drop them to pass through
                    obstacles and multipliers, aiming to collect the required number of balls to win the level.</p>

                <h3>Diorama Destruction: A Satisfying Finale</h3>

                            title="Bounce And Collect - Workers Diorama video" frameborder="0"
                            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                            allowfullscreen></iframe>

                </div>

                <p>One unique feature I wanted to experiment with in <b>Bounce and Collect</b> was creating different level
                    endings.</p>
                <p>Instead of the balls simply disappearing at the end of the level, they cascade down a diorama,
                    obliterating everything in their path.</p>
                <p>This visually satisfying conclusion encourages players to strive for the maximum number of balls
                    possible, rather than merely achieving the minimum requirement for the level.</p>

                <h3>Celebrating the Soccer World Cup: A Special Game Makeover</h3>

                <p>To commemorate the incoming Soccer World Cup, I decided to give <b>Bounce and Collect</b> a thematic
                    makeover.
                    <br />I changed the game's background to green, reminiscent of a soccer field, and replaced the
                    small colored balls with footballs and the seals with soccer goals.
                </p>
                <p>This added a realistic and festive touch to the game.</p>

                        title="Bounce And Collect - Football-themed video" frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Bounce And Collect - Football-themed video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The most exciting feature I introduced for this Soccer World Cup event was adding soccer players to
                    the levels. Positioned at fixed spots, these players would run towards incoming balls, shoot them,
                    and expel them, altering their trajectory like a pinball machine.</p>

                <p>This new mechanic further enhanced the game's engagement and challenge, offering players a fresh and
                    entertaining experience.</p>

                <p>I'm delighted with the work I've done on <b>Bounce and Collect</b> and the innovative ideas I've implemented
                    to keep players entertained. It's essential to continuously explore new ways to engage and excite
                    our players, ensuring that they have a memorable and enjoyable gaming experience.</p>
