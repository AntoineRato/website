                <h2>The Magic of Portal Mechanics: Breathing New Life into Hypercasual Mobile Games</h2>
                <p class="post-date">Posted on February 2, 2022</p>

                <p>Hello everyone! One of my favorite aspects of the job is experimenting with different mechanics and
                    adapting them to fit the hypercasual mobile game space.</p>
                <p>Today, I'd like to share with you my journey
                    in integrating one of my favorite mechanics from Valve's iconic Portal series into few voodoo games,
                    I’ll showcase 2 examples: “Shortcut Run” and “Cut This!”.
                </p>
                <h3>The Portal Twist in Shortcut Run</h3>

                            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                            allowfullscreen></iframe>

                </div>

                <p>Shortcut Run is one of the most successful games I've had the pleasure of working on. For those who
                    haven't played it, the game involves collecting boards to create paths that allow you to take
                    shortcuts and race to the finish line. In my version, I decided to add a portal mechanic that
                    players can utilize to gain an even more significant advantage during a race.</p>
                <p>In this adaptation, players must collect enough boards to ensure they don't fall into the void upon
                    exiting the portal. This addition adds an extra layer of strategy, as players must balance their
                    resource usage with the potential benefits of taking the portal shortcut.</p>

                <h3>A Puzzling Portal Adventure</h3>

                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4GK2VeBa5G0?controls=1" title="Cut This! - Portal-mechanic video"
                        frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <figcaption>Cut This! - Portal-mechanic video</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The second game I'd like to discuss is a unique puzzle game where players must cut objects to guide a
                    ball towards the final point. In this game, I added an extra twist by incorporating portal mechanics
                    as an alternative solution to each level.</p>
                <p>By passing the ball through a portal, players can create new paths to complete the level, making it
                    easier, more challenging, or even the only way to finish the level. This additional game mechanic
                    adds depth and variety to the puzzle-solving experience and encourages players to think outside the
                    box.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Integrating the portal mechanic from Valve's Portal series into my hypercasual mobile games has been
                    an exciting and rewarding experience. Not only did it breathe new life into the games, but it also
                    allowed me to explore different ways of using a beloved game mechanic in an entirely new context.
                </p>
                
                <p>As a game developer, it's essential to keep innovating and experimenting with various game mechanics.
                    By doing so, we can continue to create unique and engaging experiences for our players. So, stay
                    tuned for more exciting projects and never be afraid to think outside the box!</p>
