                <h2>Knoc Em all : Magnet Grenade</h2>
                <p class="post-date">Posted on January 6, 2022</p>

                <p>Hello, everyone! Welcome to the very first post on my blog! Today, I'll be talking about one of the
                    first games I worked on when I joined Voodoo, the popular hypercasual game, Knock'em All.
                    <br />As an FPS game featuring automatic character movement, players simply need to aim and shoot at
                    the enemies that approach them before getting hit.
                </p>

                <h3>Diverse Ammunition Types: Keeping Players Engaged</h3>

                <p>My primary contribution to Knock'em All was the addition of various ammunition types to maintain
                    player engagement and entertainment. One such ammunition type that I introduced was the sticky
                    magnetic grenade, which added a unique twist to the gameplay.</p>

                <h3>The Sticky Magnetic Grenade: Strategy and Excitement</h3>
                <p>This one-of-a-kind grenade sticks to enemies it comes in contact with and begins to attract
                    everything around it. Once the grenade has latched onto a target, it begins to attract everything
                    around it. Players must quickly avoid the grenade, as it will eventually explode after a few
                    seconds, causing significant damage to anything caught in the blast radius. This new element adds an
                    extra layer of strategy and excitement to the game, as players must not only focus on shooting
                    enemies but also dodge incoming grenades.</p>

                <h3>Creative and Innovative Ideas: A Game Developer's Journey</h3>
                <p>The magnetic sticky grenade is just one example of the kind of imaginative and innovative concepts
                    that I bring to the table as a game developer at Voodoo. I'm always searching for new ways to make
                    mobile games more engaging and enjoyable for players. I take pride in having been part of the team
                    that elevated Knock'em All to its current level of success.</p>

                <p>Thank you for reading my very first post and for joining me on this journey as I share my experiences
                    and insights in the world of mobile game development. Stay tuned for more updates, and don't forget
                    to have fun gaming!</p>
