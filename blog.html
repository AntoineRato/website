                        <h3>The Magic of Portal Mechanics</h3>
                        <p class="post-description">In this post, I explore how I integrated the portal mechanic from
                            Valve's popular Portal series into two hypercasual mobile games, "Shortcut Run" and "Cut This!".
                        </p>
                        <p class="post-description">I talk about how this addition added an extra layer of strategy and depth to the games, encouraging players to think outside the box. As someone who enjoys experimenting with different
                            mechanics, I found this process to be exciting and rewarding, allowing me to explore new
                            ways of incorporating beloved game mechanics into entirely new contexts.</p>
                        <p class="post-description"> If you're a fan of hypercasual mobile games or enjoy learning about
                            the creative process behind game development, be sure to check out this post!</p>

                        <!-- <img src="images/knockemall_magnetgrenade.png" alt="Knoc Em all : Magnet Grenade image"> -->
                        <p class="post-description">In this firt blog post, I introduce the popular mobile game Knock'em
                            All and discuss my contribution to the game, which was adding various ammunition types to
                            keep players engaged.</p>

                        <p class="post-description">Specifically, I talk about the sticky magnetic grenade, which adds
                            an extra layer of strategy and excitement to the game. As a game developer, I'm always
                            searching for new ways to make mobile games more engaging and enjoyable for players.</p>
