                        <h3>A Magnetic Twist: Introducing a Game-Changing Feature in Pusher 3D</h3>

                        <p class="post-description">In this post, I discuss an exciting new feature I introduced in
                            Pusher 3D, a game inspired by the tug-of-war concept. The goal involves sending units to
                            stack and merge to push opponents out of the ring.</p>

                        <p class="post-description">I added a magnet feature that randomly activates during the game,
                            attracting everything in its path. The trap not only adds challenge, but also creates a
                            visually satisfying and exciting effect when it attracts a significant number of units.</p>

                        <p class="post-description">Check out the post to learn more about the magnet feature in Pusher
                            3D!</p>
